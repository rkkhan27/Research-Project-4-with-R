## Financial Stressors and Cognitive Performance

Do changes in one’s financial circumstances affect one’s decision-making process and cognitive capacity? In a
research study, researchers randomly selected a group of US respondents to be surveyed before their payday
and another group to be surveyed after their payday. People working for different employers or in different
jobs get paid at different times. So at any given time, some people will have just been paid and others
will be waiting to be paid. Under this design, the researchers believed that the respondents of the Before
Payday group would be more likely to be financially strained (which we will consider to be the treatment)
than those of the After Payday group (which we will consider to be the alternative). The researchers were
interested in investigating whether or not being financially strained affects people’s decision making and
cognitive performance. Other researchers have found that in a lab setting, scarcity induces an additional
mental load that impedes cognitive capacity.

In this study, the researchers administered a number of decision-making and cognitive performance tasks to
the Before Payday and After Payday groups. We focus on the Numerical Stroop Task, which measures
cognitive control. An example of a Numerical Stroop Task would be to present two numbers side by side,
and vary the font sizes so that sometimes the lower number is in a bigger font than the higher number and
vice versa and test how long it takes the subject to correctly identify which number is larger and how many
errors they make. In general, taking more time to complete this task indicates less cognitive control and
reduced cognitive ability. They also measured the amount of cash the respondents have on hand, the amount
of money in their checking and saving accounts, and whether or not they have a low annual income.
